# Exhibition Space : Curtin Design Grad Show 2022
This is the Git repo for the 2022 Curtin University Design Grad Show (Manual Launch). 

We can work on this website and after any pushes to main I will manually upload to SiteGround where the site will
be live at the curtin domains. Or we can work on the previous GitHub repo and work on getting the curtin domain names
into the Vercel website, as the Vercel website does function better.
